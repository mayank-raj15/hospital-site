# Doctor's Attendance & Appointment Booking System (hospital site)

The project on ”Doctor’s Attendance & Appointment Booking System” was
done to create an online platform for users, specifically the people of IIT Indore,
which will allow them to avail facilities like - checking the availability of
a doctor and booking an appointment. The platform also allows the healthcare
staff to maintain records of patients, doctor’s attendance & availability,
and schedule of appointments.

The project solves a real-world problem involving specific use cases of the
processes followed in the Health Center of IIT Indore. Here at IIT Indore,
whenever a doctor visits, we are communicated through email to book an
appointment. In the case of many doctors, it becomes difficult for the user
and the staff to maintain the records. This project solves this problem to
the extent that it becomes a seamless process and requires minimal interaction,
even in the worst cases.
